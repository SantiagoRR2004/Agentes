This project simulates a family in which a member knows who their parents and children are and they communicate with each other to know who their extended family is.

## [Domotic Environment](../domestic_robot/)

This is the main project that accounted for 50% of the final grade. It was made by a team of 7 people and handed in two times. The first submission was on Monday, the 17th of November of 2025. The final submission took place on Sunday, the 18th of January of 2028, and earned a grade of 8.75 for the code and 8 for the report. The code was 35% and the report was 15% of the final grade.

### Project Summary

This project involves an advanced domestic environment featuring an `owner`, `robot` and `intruder`. There is a more thorough explanation in the [README](../domestic_robot/docs/README.md) file of the project, but in summary, the `robot` is the most important agent because it is the one that cleans the house.
